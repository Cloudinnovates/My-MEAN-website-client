# My M.E.A.N. website
<br>

## Informations
My MEAN website is a web application that I'm creating as a personal website, but also for other uses.
It's composed by:
- a front-end in AngularJS 1
- a back-end in Node.js + Express js (and other useful libs like Passport and so on)
- a db in MongoDb
- gulp + nodemon

A possible extension of this project is a configurable template to build a custom web app very quickly.

Attention! This project is still an alpha, so it's not production ready. Please be careful.
If you are interested, please star this project on GitHub.

Testing:
- front-end unit: useless, because I want to rewrite the entire front-end using Angular 2
- front-end e2e: useless, because I want to rewrite the entire front-end using Angular 2
- back-end unit: almost done (only the necessary things)
- back-end integration: almost done
